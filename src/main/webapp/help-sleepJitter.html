<div>
    The maximum allowed value of the polling jitter. This is a random value
    between zero and the specified maximum which is added to the poll time. This randomizes the API call pattern and
    prevents throttling for workloads with parallel builds. <br>

    The default value is 5 seconds. The maximum allowed value is 28800 (eight hours). <br>

    The plugin increases the poll time by one second every cycle until the maximum poll
    time is reached (default 60 seconds) and then adds the jitter.
