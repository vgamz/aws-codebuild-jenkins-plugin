<div>
    Optional parameter. This field is meant to be used with parameters stored in Amazon EC2 Systems Manager Parameter Store. If you have a
    parameter named "param" that maps to a secret string "secret", then you can put the environment variable {VAR, param} in this input field and CodeBuild will
    decrypt the parameter and pass the environment variable {VAR, secret} to your build. These environment variables will be passed to the StartBuild API and will override any project environment variables.
    You may need to modify your project's service role by adding access to GetParameters, which will allow CodeBuild to access any parameters that you specify.

    <br/>

    Example:
    <code>
        [
            {
                VAR,
                Parameter1
            }
        ]
    </code>

    <br/>

    Example:
    <code>
        [
            {
                VAR,
                Parameter1
            },
            {
                VAR2,
                Parameter2
            }
        ]
    </code>

    <br/>
    <br/>

    Commas in the name or value must be escaped. For freestyle projects, escape with one backslash:

    <br/>

    <code>
        [
        {
        VAR,
        value1\,value2
        }
        ]
    </code>

    <br/>

    For pipeline projects, escape with two backslashes:

    <br/>

    <code>
        awsCodeBuild ... envVariables: '[{VAR, value1\\,value2}]'
    </code>
</div>
