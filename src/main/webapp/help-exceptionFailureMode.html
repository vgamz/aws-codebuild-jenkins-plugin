<div>
    If set to ENABLED and a failure is detected (e.g., invalid configuration or a failed CodeBuild build): throws a CodeBuildException for pipeline
    builds and an AbortException for all other builds.
    DISABLED signifies the existing behavior in which the Jenkins build result is set to FAILURE (a CodeBuildException is also thrown for pipeline builds).
    The default value is DISABLED.
