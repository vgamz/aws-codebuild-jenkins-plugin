<div>
    The local path of your source zip file relative to the workspace for your Jenkins project. If this parameter is nonempty,
    the plugin will upload the file you specify instead of zipping and uploading your entire project workspace.

    Your local source file will be uploaded to the project source location. For example, if you configure the
    plugin to upload local-source.zip and your CodeBuild project has S3 source location bucket/s3-source.zip, then
    the plugin will upload the contents of local-source.zip to the S3 location bucket/s3-source.zip.
