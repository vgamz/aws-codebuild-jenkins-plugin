<div>
    Optional parameter. These environment variables will be passed to the StartBuild API and will override any project environment variables.

    <br/>

    Example:
    <code>
        [
            {
                VAR,
                value
            }
        ]
    </code>

    <br/>

    Example:
    <code>
        [
            {
                VAR,
                value
            },
            {
                VAR2,
                value
            }
        ]
    </code>

    <br/>
    <br/>

    Commas in the name or value must be escaped. For freestyle projects, escape with one backslash:

    <br/>

    <code>
        [
        {
        VAR,
        value1\,value2
        }
        ]
    </code>

    <br/>

    For pipeline projects, escape with two backslashes:

    <br/>

    <code>
        awsCodeBuild ... envVariables: '[{VAR, value1\\,value2}]'
    </code>

</div>
